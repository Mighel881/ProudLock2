# ProudLock X🅁
Be proud of that lock – Reloaded!

This is a developer-only release of ProudLock for iOS 12 and iOS 13

ProudLock enables the Face ID latch glyph, internally called SBUIProudLockIconView, on older devices.

This is the iOS 12 and 13 variant of ProudLock. It currently makes the Face ID latch appear on the lock screen, and that's about it.

ProudLock X🅁 works great in addition to [Notch'd](https://github.com/SniperGER/NotchSimulator) or similar iPhone X UI tweaks.
