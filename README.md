# ProudLock XüÖÅ
Be proud of that lock ‚Äì Reloaded!

This is a developer-only release of ProudLock for iOS 12

ProudLock enables the Face ID latch glyph, internally called SBUIProudLockIconView, on older devices.

This is the iOS 12 variant of ProudLock. It currently makes the Face ID latch appear on the lock screen, but that's about it. In addition to make the latch actually work as expected, 9:16 aspect ratio devices (iPhone 8/Plus and lower) may need some layout work to move the clock down.
